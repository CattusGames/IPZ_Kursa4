# IPZ_Kursa4
 This term paper is a sequence of a flurry of term papers at my educational institution. The madness lies in the fact that this work has absolutely no meaning, does not encourage students to do it at all, even for those for whom this task is very simple. And now I turn to the teachers who will read this description: With this attitude towards students in writing tasks for them, you create a vicious circle of meaningless existence in this world. For many students, it is not enough to just know hard skills, it is important for them to know in which areas it can be applied, so I ask you to do tasks with a focus on Reality. Give tasks to solve a problem in a certain real subject area, and not mathematical problems in the spirit of "adding 2+2 so that it is not too difficult and too easy." I had a great teacher in college who followed the rules I described above. There he gave real problems from real life, there was an individual approach to each problem. And it was interesting for us to do his coursework because before applying our hard skills, we needed to research the subject area with which we work. If you sneeze at students, don't be surprised that they answer you in the same way. What you sow is what you reap!"
